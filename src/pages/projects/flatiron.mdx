[Flatiron Health](https://www.flatiron.com) is a leader in accelerating cancer
research through the use of real world data. Flatiron's products connect community
oncologists, academics, hospitals, life science researchers and regulators on a shared
technology platform.

# Tech Lead

I began at Flatiron in 2017 as an entry-level hire. I later became the tech
lead of a team responsible for the accurate and efficient collection of
unstructured clinical data. This internal team provided critical services
to enable the delivery of Flatiron's
[real world evidence products](https://flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/).

### AngularJS to React Migration

After a company-mandate, I led the technical transition of a monolithic AngularJS frontend
to React. This included building interoperability tools for incremental migrations, mitigating
rollout risk, and establishing best practices for a team initially unfamiliar with React. The
tools and practices I developed were used across the wider company after success on our team.

This project was eventually handed off to a dedicated subteam I advocated for, to better
allow the orginization to make progress on both this technical migration and product work
at once.

### Collecting Health Data

Identified the need for, and then developed, the second version of the primary UX by which
Flatiron collected structured health data. This second version was developed to be significantly
more modular, to allow teams to use shared building blocks across a long tail of related workflows.

This included removing restrictive global/singleton state, breaking apart monolithic logic into
composible pieces, and more explicitly defining dataflow, validation, and serialization.

While in hindsight I would have done some things differently, this investment proved very valuable
for Flatiron's Abstraction Teams. This rework served as a foundations for a variety of features
previously thought to be too difficult to implement.

### AutoClient

Independently developed an internal tool, "AutoClient", that allowed teams to much more rapidly
expose operational or experimental features to end users while maintaining a high technical bar.

AutoClient was integrated into the stack of several teams, and was met with praise from developers
by allowing them to remain "AGILE" by delivering and testing early features much quicker.

# Team Hackathon

Flatiron hosts an internal 3-day hackathon each quarter with over 200 engineers,
designers, and clinicians working on whatever they choose.

I assisted with the execution of 8 Hackathons. I revamped the categories and prizes
to focus more on the value-add of potential projects, branded the event, and MC'd
all-company events alongside company leadership.
