# Tech Lead

I began at Flatiron in 2017 as an entry-level hire. Currently, I am the tech
lead of a team responsible for the accurate and efficient collection of
unstructured clinical data. This internal team provides critical services
to enable the delivery of Flatiron's
[real world evidence products](https://flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/).

_I am currently awaiting approval to describe some of the projects I have
lead as a tech lead._

# Senior Software Engineer

_I am currently awaiting approval to describe some of the projects I have
completed as an individual contributor._

# Team Hackathon

Flatiron hosts an internal 3-day hackathon each quarter with over 200 engineers,
designers, and clinicians working on whatever they choose.

I assisted with the execution of 8 Hackathons. I revamped the categories and prizes
to focus more on the value-add of potential projects, branded the event, and MC'd
all-company events alongside company leadership.
