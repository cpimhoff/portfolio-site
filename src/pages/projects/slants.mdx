Slants was a project built with the very first version of the
[Swift programming language](https://swift.org). It was a simple, yet
challenging arcade game for iOS.

In Slants, the goal is to use a shape to sort falling blips to their corresponding
side of the screen. By sorting blips correctly, the shape used to sort can be scored
for a point, and then the shape changes.

Slants supported online leaderboards and was updated several times with new modes.
